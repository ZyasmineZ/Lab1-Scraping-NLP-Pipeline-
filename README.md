# Lab1-Scraping-NLP-Pipeline-

This project demonstrates various techniques for Arabic text processing using Python and NLP libraries.

## Overview

The project involves the following tasks:

1. **Web Scraping with Scrapy**: Scraping data from Arabic web sources related to a specific domain and storing it in a MongoDB database.

2. **Data Storage with MongoDB**: Storing raw data in MongoDB, a NoSQL database, for efficient retrieval and management.

3. **NLP Pipeline**: Implementing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline including text cleaning, tokenization, stop word removal, discretization, and normalization.

4. **Stemming and Lemmatization Comparison**: Comparing stemming and lemmatization techniques to understand their impact on text processing tasks.

5. **Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging**: Applying POS tagging using both rule-based and machine learning approaches to analyze the grammatical structure of Arabic sentences.

6. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Implementing NER methods to identify and classify named entities such as persons, organizations, and locations in Arabic text.
