# Arabic Text Processing with NLP Techniques

This repository documents a comprehensive Arabic text processing pipeline using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project encompasses data scraping from Arabic web sources, storing the raw data in a MongoDB NoSQL database, and implementing NLP tasks such as text cleaning, tokenization, stop words removal, discretization, and normalization.

## Project Overview

1. **Scraping Arabic Web Sources:** Utilized Scrapy to scrape data from specific domains of Arabic websites, gathering relevant text data for further analysis.

2. **Data Storage with MongoDB:** Stored the scraped raw data in a MongoDB NoSQL database, ensuring efficient data retrieval and management.

3. **NLP Pipeline Implementation:**
   - **Text Cleaning:** Removed noise, irrelevant characters, and special symbols from the raw text data.
   - **Tokenization:** Segmented text into individual words or tokens, facilitating further analysis.
   - **Stop Words Removal:** Eliminated common stop words from the text to focus on meaningful content.
   - **Discretization:** Processed text data to discretize numerical values or categorical variables as needed.
   - **Normalization:** Applied techniques like Unicode normalization, case normalization, and whitespace normalization to standardize text representations.

4. **Stemming and Lemmatization Comparison:**
   - Conducted a comparative analysis of stemming and lemmatization techniques to evaluate their effectiveness.
   - Found that lemmatization outperformed stemming in terms of preserving semantic integrity and context, making it the preferred choice for Arabic text processing tasks.

5. **Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging:**
   - Implemented both rule-based and machine learning-based approaches for POS tagging to analyze grammatical structures and word categorization within the text.

6. **Named Entity Recognition (NER) Methods:**
   - Explored NER methods to identify and classify named entities such as persons, organizations, and locations in the text data.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we gained insights into the complexities of Arabic text processing and the significance of employing appropriate NLP techniques. Lemmatization emerged as the preferred method over stemming due to its ability to maintain semantic coherence and enhance the accuracy of downstream NLP tasks. By leveraging advanced NLP techniques, we can unlock valuable insights and knowledge from Arabic text data, paving the way for applications in sentiment analysis, information extraction, and text summarization.
